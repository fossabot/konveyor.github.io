Sysadmins and Developers are tired of the words “Digital Transformation.” They don’t want to hear about the “five keys to digital transformation” or the “seven must-haves to transform.” They are also tired of every vendor presenting their framework and methodology for digital transformation bundled with a bunch of proprietary tools.
Developers and sysadmins want to learn how to actually transform their applications and infrastructure so they can take advantage of new technologies to deliver new capabilities faster, at greater scale, and with higher quality while reducing technical debt.</description></item></channel></rss>
